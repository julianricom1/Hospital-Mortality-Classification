# Hospital-Mortality-Classification

Purpose
The purpose of this document is to outline the learning objectives set at the beginning of the course, which include:

Identifying problems that can be solved using supervised Machine Learning.
Implementing a supervised Machine Learning solution to practical problems.
Evaluating the performance of supervised Machine Learning models.
Problem Description
Predicting hospital mortality for critically ill patients is crucial due to the increasing concern over the loss of control patients experience toward the end of life. Accurate predictions allow for proactive decision-making to reduce the frequency of a mechanical, painful, and prolonged dying process. The goal is to design a classifier that predicts the mortality of these patients based on various physiological, demographic, and disease severity characteristics.

Dataset
The provided dataset is data_train.csv, which contains a total of 9,105 patient records. The features of the dataset include:

Physiological information of the patients
Demographic data
Information on disease severity
Mortality indicators at 2 and 6 months
Hospital mortality column (hospdead, the label to predict)
